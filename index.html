Few  games combine breathtaking visuals, compelling gameplay, and deeply emotional storytelling
  as Ori and the Will of the Wisps. As the sequel to Ori and the Blind Forest, this game elevates every aspect of its
  predecessor, introducing richer world-building, refined mechanics, and a narrative that speaks to the essence of 
  sacrifice and purpose. At its core, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is not just an adventure, is a profound
  meditation on resistance, loss, and the bonds that shape us.
