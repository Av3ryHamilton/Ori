<head></head>
<body><font size="5">Few  games combine breathtaking visuals, compelling gameplay, and deeply emotional storytelling
  as Ori and the Will of the Wisps. As the sequel to Ori and the Blind Forest, this game elevates every aspect of its
  predecessor. It introduces richer world-building, refined mechanics, and a narrative that speaks to the essence of 
  sacrifice and purpose. At its core, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is not just an adventure, but a profound
  meditation on resistance, loss, and the bonds that shape us.</body> </font>

  <br><center><font size="11">Ori</br></font></center></br> 
 <center> <img src="Ori Icon.png" alt="Our Hero of the Wisp"></center>
  <br><center><font size="5">Ori is the heart of the game, a luminous spirit guardian whose journey is filled with trials that
  test courage and resilience. Ori's unwavering determination to protect those they love drives the emotional
  core of the story and find the missing owl named Ku.</br></font></center> 
   <br><center><font size="5"> Ori's journey reflects Freud's structural model of the psyche, particularly the relationship between
     The ego and superego. The ego in Ori's journey represents adaptation; Ori must evolve to navigate the world's challenges while
    keeping their sense of purpose intact. Meanwhile, the superego (the moral compass) manifests in Ori's self-sacrificing action.
    Ori does not act purely for survival, but for the well-being of others, reinforcing the psychological idea that true strength
     comes from balancing instinct and morality.</br></font></center>
<br><center><font size="11">Ku</br></font></center>
  <center><img src="Ku.png" alt="Owl"></center>
  <br><center><font size="5"> Introduced as Ori's companion, Ku is a young owl whose bond with Ori is at the heart of the game's
emotional narrative. Her journey symbolizes the importance of trust and perseverance in adversity.
She also has a wing that was infected due to the events that happened in the prequel Ori and the Blind Forest </br></font></center>
<br><center><font size="11">Naru & Gumo</br></font></center>
<center><img src="Naru.png" alt="Mother"></center>
<center><img src="Gumo.png" alt="Found family"></center>
<br> <center><font size="5">Found family is also important. Naru and Humo, returning from the first game, provide an emotional foundation.
  A reminder that love is not only about protection but about shared struggles and unwavering support. And they so much
  love for the Ori and Ku to go find them in the new area, that are located called Niwen.</br></font></center>
<br> <center> <font size="11">Kwolok</br></font></body>
<center><img src="Kwolok.png" alt="Gurdian"></center>
<br><center><font size="5"> Kwolok is a towering amphibian who serves as the guardian of the marsh. Unlike many others in Niwen,
  he retains his wisdom and compassion despite the corruption spreading through the land. He guides Ori, offering 
  insights that help shape the journey, making him one of the few truly benevolent figures in the game. However,
  his fate is tragic;  his battle against the Foul presence ultimately consumes him, reinforcing the theme that 
  even the strongest must make sacrifices for the greater good.</br></font></center>
<br><center><font size="15">Shriek</br></font></center>
<center><img src="Shriek.png" alt="Gurdian"></center>
<br><center><font size="5"> Shriek is the most tragic figure in Ori and the Will of the Wisps. Born into a world of decay, she was abandoned
  and forced to survive in isolation/ Her hostility toward Ori is not driven by malice but by deep-seated pain.
  As the primary antagonist, Shriek represents the consequences of cruelty and abandonment, showing how a creature formed by
  suffering can struggle with redemption.</br></font></center>
 <br><center><font size="5"> Freud believed that the unconscious mind holds repressed memories and desires that shape behavior,
    Shriek is a perfect embodiment of this idea, born into an environment of desolation and rejection, she internalized her
    trauma, causing her to lash out violently. Shriek's hostility towards Ori and Niwen is not rooted in natural malice but in a
    defense mechanism against deep abandonment. Her rejection by fellow owls mirrors Freud's theory that early childhood
    rejection and neglect can lead to antisocial behaviors.</br></font></center>
<p><center><font size="15">Synopsis: A World on the Brink</font></center></p>
<center>  <img src="Niwen map.png" alt="Map"></center>
<body><font size="5"> Niwen is a land in decay, its balance disrupted by the corruption consuming its heart. As Ori sets out to reunite
with Ku, they become entangled in a larger struggle, the fate of the land itself. The journey leads Ori across vibrant landscapes,
from eerie ruins to lush forests, each filled with secrets and challenges. Along the way, Ori must make painful choices, proving
that sacrifice is not simply about loss but about ensuring something greater can endure. The resolution of the story cements the 
game's overarching themes: purpose is found not in self-preservation but in what we give to others.</body></font>
<p><center><font size="15">Bosses: Gurdians and Foes of Niwen </font></center></p>
  <br><font size="11">Howl: The Feral Beast</br></font>
  <br><font size="5"> Encountered early in Inkwater Marsh, Howl is the first major foe  Ori faces. A savage, wolf-like creature, Howl 
  sets the tone for the dangers ahead, forcing Ori to quickly adapt to combat mechanics and defensive  manevers.

  <br><font size="15">Hornbug (Horn Beetle): The Relentless Charger</br></font>
  <br><font size="5"> Deep within Kwolok's Hollow, Ori faces the Hornbug, a powerful enemy that relies on brute force and charging
  attacks. This encounter tests Ori's ability to dodge and counterattack efficiently. Watch the Hornbug boss fight here:</br></font><video width="320" height="240" controls>

 <br><font size="15"> Kwolok: The Corrupted Gurdian</br></font>
  <br><font size="5"> While Kwolok serves as an important mentor figure, the story takes a tragic turn when he falls victim to corruption or the creature
  that he ran away from when retrieving the water. Ori is forced to battle him, an emotional fight that contrasts with his earlier wisdom
  and protection. His corruption is not a personal failing but a consequence og the relentless decay affecting Niwen. His loss serves as a
  heartbreaking moment that reinforces the idea that even the noble will make a sacrifice for the good of others. Watch the
  Kowolok boss fight here:</br></font><video width="320" height="240" controls>

</video>
  <br><font size="5"> Freud's Thanatos (death drive) is the concept that organisms, including humans, have an unconscious pull toward destruction and 
  self-awareness and control. His corruption into a force of destruction mirrors Freud's idea that under extreme circumstances, even figures of wisdom 
  and guidance can fall into the unconscious pull of chaos. His tragic fate serves as an emotional catharsis, as Ori must defeat him despite their past bond.</br></font>
 <br><font size="15">Mora: The Nightmare of Mouldwood Depths</br></font>
  <br><font size="5"> In the eerie, pitch-black Mouldwood Depths, Ori encounters Mora, a spider that
  thrives in the darkness, which was corrupted by the decay, causing her to lose her mind. The battle requires precise movement 
  and mystery of light-based mechanics, as the arena remains perilously dark, which will harm you throughout the encounter.

</video>
<br><font size="15">Shriek: The Tormented Shadow</br></font>
  <br><font size="5">Shriek is the final boss and the most tragic boss to fight in the game. Born into an unforgiving world of loss of rejection. The battle 
against shriek unfolds in three phases, each demanding precise movement and strategy. Her defeat is not a triumphant victory but a sorrowful 
conclusion to a creature shaped by suffering. Watch the Shriek boss fight here:</br></font><video width="320" height="240" controls>

<p><center><font size="15"> Gameplay & Mechanics: Art of Movement </font></center></p>
<center><br><font size="5"> Beyond its narrative, Ori and the Will of the Wisps refines the mechanics that made its
  predecessor so compelling. The fluid plateforming, enhanced abilities,  and dynamic combat make the
  experience seamless and rewarding. Each new skill Ori learns is not simply an upgrade but a metaphor 
  for growth-movement is expression, and mastering Ori's agility reflects the evolution of purpose. 
  The game's stunning artistic direction heightens every moment. Hand-painted environments blend seamlessly
  With a soaring orchestral score, ensuring that every scene carries emotional weight. The sweeping melodies 
  composed by Gareth Coker complements the journey, allowing the story to resonate long after the final scene
  fades </center></br></font>
<p><center><font size="15"> Themes: Purpose and sacrifices as Storytelling Pillars</font></center></p>
<center><br><font size="5">What sets Ori and the Will of the Wisps apart is its ability to convey powerful themes without a spoken word. 
Ori's journey is one of determination, proving that purpose is forged through adversity. The sacrifices made throughout
the story reflect the painful, beautiful truth of life. Sometimes, to protect what we love, we must be willing to let go.
The game challenges players to reconsider what heroism truly means. It is not brute strength or dominance, but the willingness
to fight for others despite the cost. This theme echoes throughout each interaction, from quiet moments of reflection to intense
battles that test Ori's resolve. Here is a video of the ending:</center></br></font><video width="320" height="240" controls>
